    <p>Plate of spaghetti and meatballs in sauce</p>
    <br />
    <p1>
      This is an Italian-style pasta sauce with homemade meatballs that's cooked
      slowly over low heat for an intense tomato flavor. It's easy to make the
      spaghetti sauce ahead of time; gently reheat and add meatballs 30 minutes
      before you're ready to serve with your favorite pasta.
